/**Say we have a 2 dimensional DList. 
We want this 2-D DList to be as even as possible. 
To do this we will try to fill up rows as uniformly as possible- 
meaning that not row will have a greater size than any other row 
by more than 1 element. 
Write a method that will take in a sub DList and add the given element 
if it fulfills the constraints. If the constraints are not fulfilled, 
the item will be attempted to be put in the DList below the one 
you attempted to insert in originally and so forth until the bottom 
most DList is reached in which case move to the top DList.
